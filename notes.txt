- what example code am I using? what language? 
- what tests am I going to run?
- can I include statistical tests?


General:
- keep it simple
X give brief intro to source control and git
X what is github actions
X explain the most common use cases (CI/CD in devops)
X explain the usefullness in research code development, specifically TEAMS


ideas for example code
- lake model
  X deveoping the model, running the tests, continual workflow with everyone 
  - example, configuration with Numba? how would this work?
  - optimizing in Python 
X pyborg (not released)
X platypus or rhodium (these workflows exist though ... )
X MOEAFramework (alredy exists, not applicable)
X waterpaths (too complicated and fucked up rn)
